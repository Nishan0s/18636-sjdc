    <!--Used to add paragraphs-->
    <p>Bhagat Singh (28 September 1907[1] – 23 March 1931) was an Indian anti-colonial revolutionary,[3] who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in December 1928[4] in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.[5] He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India</p>
